  <h2>Here is what we've found out about Echo Chamber in Twitter: </h2>

  <h3>Current Findings</h3>
  <p>According to the research <span style="font-style: italic">Political Discourse on Social Media: Echo Chambers, Gatekeepers, and the Price of Bipartisanship.</span>, political echo chambers exist. In particular, the distribution of production and consumption polarities of users is clearly bi-modal, and the production and consumption polarities are highly correlated.[1]</p>

  <h3>Agglomerative Clustering</h3>
  <center>{% include 'agglomerative.html' %}</center>
  <h3>Spectral Clustering</h3>
  <center>{% include 'spectral.html' %}</center>
  <h3>Heatmap</h3>
  <center>{% include 'heatmap.html' %}</center>
  <p>With the heatmap, we can see that there are two clear clusterings! This indicates that the users we investigated are highly polarized.</p>

  <h3>Network Analysis</h3>
  <p>We also created a network of twitter users in the dataset with NetworkX, used the modularity method to separate possible communities, and plotted it using Gephi.</p>

  <p>It's actually quite similar to the clustering we created using polarity scores!</p>
  <p>Takeaway: there's a strong correlation between the Twitter social network structures and derived polarity scores!</p>
