  <h2>What is an Echo Chamber?</h2>
  <p>In discussion of news media, an <span style="font-weight: bold">Echo chamber </span> refers to an environment where a person only encounters information or opinions that reflect and reinforce their own. Here, our project studies the phenomenon of political echo chambers in social media.</p>
  <p>There is an increasing concerns for the political discourse in many democratic countries that, as citizens become more polarized about political issues, they do not hear the arguments of the opposite side, but are rather surrounded by people and news sources who express only opinions they agree with. If echo chambers exist, then they might hamper the deliberative process in democracy. [1]</p>
